# 🎬 Netflix Movie Recommendation System (Content-Based Filtering)

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **Content-Based Filtering Recommendation System** for movies on Netflix.  
By analyzing movie metadata such as **genres, cast, crew, and descriptions**, the system recommends movies that are similar to a user’s preferences.  

The project is designed to demonstrate practical application of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **machine learning techniques** in building personalized recommendation engines.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Preprocess and clean movie dataset  
- Extract meaningful features (genres, keywords, cast, crew)  
- Apply **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **Cosine Similarity** for content-based filtering  
- Build a recommendation function that suggests movies similar to a given title  
- Document workflow and results in Jupyter Notebook & Project Report

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, nltk, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Techniques:** TF-IDF Vectorization, Cosine Similarity, NLP preprocessing  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, GitHub

## 📊 Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Clean and normalize text data  
   - Extract features: genres, keywords, cast, crew  

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Apply **TF-IDF Vectorization** on movie descriptions  
   - Create combined feature vectors  

3. **Similarity Computation**  
   - Use **Cosine Similarity** to measure closeness between movies  

4. **Recommendation Function**  
   - Input: Movie title  
   - Output: Top N similar movies

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ashishraj-hub/Netflix-Movie-Recommendation-System-Content-Based-Filtering.git
   ``` 
2.Navigate to the project folder:
  ```bash
cd Netflix-Movie-Recommendation-System-Content-Based-Filtering
 ```
3.Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4.Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Major\ Project\ 2.ipynb
 ```

# 📈 Results
The system successfully recommends movies based on content similarity.

Example: Inputting "Inception" returns movies with similar genres, themes, and cast.
